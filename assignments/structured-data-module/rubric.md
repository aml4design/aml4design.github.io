# Grading Rubric (Group Assignment)

**Assessment of Learning Goal 1: Quality of describing the experiment design (45%)**
- Excellent (9-10)
  - The experiment design is rich and clearly justified about how such design can help identify local pollution patterns
- Good (7-8)
  - The experiment design is adequate and properly justified about how such design can help identify local pollution patterns
- Sufficient (6)
  - The experiment design is reasonable. But, the justification about how such design can help identify local pollution patterns may not be clear.
- Insufficient (<6)
  - The experiment design has low quality. The rationality and motivation of the experiment is poorly justified.

**Assessment of Learning Goal 2: Quality of critically reflecting the experiment and supporting the findings with evidence (45%)**
- Excellent (9-10)
  - The findings are rich, explained in a clear way that lay people can understand, and supported with strong evidence from the experiment results.
- Good (7-8)
  - The findings are adequate, explained in a proper manner for lay people, and supported with proper evidence from the experiment results.
- Sufficient (6)
  - Findings are provided. But some of them are not explained properly or not supported with evidence from the experiment.
- Insufficient (<6)
  - The findings have low quality, not explained well, and are not supported with evidence from the experiment.

**Assessment of Learning Goal 3: Ability to automate the experiment (weight 10%)**
- Excellent (9-10)
  - The experiment is fully automated, has good documentation about how the code works, and has very good code quality.
- Good (7-8)
  - The experiment is fully automated, has reasonable documentation about how the code works, and has the code be mostly human-readable.
- Sufficient (6)
  - Some parts of the experiment are automated but some parts require human effort. Have some documentation about how the code works, but some may not be clear. Some parts of the code are hard to understand.
- Insufficient (<6)
  - The experiment is not automated, or some parts are automated with no documentation and poor code quality.
