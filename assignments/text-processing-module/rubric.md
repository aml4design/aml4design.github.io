- Excellent (9-10)
    - Analysis includes:
        1. Manual analysis
        2. Wordclouds
        3. Preprocessing 
        4. Sentiment analysis
        5. Topic modeling
- Good (7-8)
    - Analysis includes:  
        1. Manual analysis
        2. Wordclouds
        3. Preprocessing 
        4. Sentiment analysis
- Sufficient (6)
    - Analysis includes:  
        1. Manual analysis
        2. Wordclouds
        3. Preprocessing 
- Insufficient (<6)
    - Analysis is done only manually, no processing is done

**Assessment of Learning Goal 2: To reflect on how to select and tune text processing methods according to the design problem a designer has at hand.**
- Excellent (9-10)
    1. Students show an understanding of all the methods they applied
    2. Students present a clear motivation regarding the methods selection process.
    3. Students present a clear motivation regarding the methods’ parameters selection process
    4. Students reflect clearly and precisely  on the implications and limitations of the text-processing techniques.
- Good (7-8)
    1. Students show an understanding of all the methods they applied.
    2. Students include a basic motivation regarding the methods selection process.
    3. Students include a basic motivation regarding the methods’ parameters selection process
    4. Students reflect on the implications and limitations of the text-processing techniques.
- Sufficient (6)
    1. Students show an understanding of the most methods they applied
    2. Include some motivation regarding the methods or the parameters they selected.
    3. Students include a reflection on the implications and limitations of the text-processing techniques.
- Insufficient (<6)
    1. Students show very limited understanding of applied methods
    2. Students include a very limited motivation regarding the selection of methods and parameters they used.
    3. Students poorly reflect on the implications and limitations of the text-processing techniques.

**Assessment of Learning Goal 3: To learn how to translate insights gained from the text processing methods into design decisions.**
- Excellent (9-10)
    - Report includes:
        1. Detailed description of steps in text analysis
        2. Reasoning behind the most of decisions made during analysis
        3. Examples from the texts that demonstrate the findings and motivate selected suggestions 
- Good (7-8)
    - Report includes:
        1. Description of the most of the steps in text analysis
        2. Reasoning behind some of decisions made during analysis
        3. Examples from the texts that demonstrate some findings or motivate selected suggestions 
- Sufficient (6)
    - Report includes:
        1. Description of some of the steps in text analysis
        2. Decisions during analysis are mostly not explained (but key ones are)
        3. A couple of examples from text collections but they mostly don’t help to understand the findings or selected suggestions
- Insufficient (<6)
    - No description on how analysis was done, no supporting quotes from the text collection.
